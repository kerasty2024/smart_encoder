This package contains the encoding pipelines for the Smart Encoder application.

A pipeline orchestrates the entire encoding process for a specific task,
such as standard video encoding or phone-specific encoding. It is responsible for
discovering files, managing concurrent processing, and coordinating the various
services (e.g., file processing, encoding, logging).
